       <div><b>HTML</b> stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language.</em> which is what defines most web pages.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>HTML is made up of the following...
        <br>
        Text content shows what you see.  
        <br>
        Markup shows what your page will look like.
        <br>
        References to other documents, such as images are possible.
        <br>
        Links to other web pages are possible too.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div><b>HTML</b> uses tags in a certain structure to create a webpage, such as !doctype, head, title, body, etc.
      </div>        
      <br>
      <div><b>Tags</b> are what HTML uses  to mark text in a certain way.  
        <br>A tag normally has an opening tag, text, then a closing tag. 
        <br>
        Tags that do not contain content are called "void" tags.
        <br>
        I learned how to use <b>bold</b> and to provide emphasis via the <em>italics</em> tags.
      </div>
        <br>
      <div>Tags can be either           <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
      <br>
      Inline tags examples are break, bold, emphasis, void tags, new lines, etc.
      <br>
      Block tags create an invisible block around the content.  Examples of this is paragraph and div.
      </div>
     <br>
    <div><b>Attributes</b>, ATTR equal a vallue.   
      <br>The <a href=www.udacity.com">anchor tag</a> creates links to other websites.

      <br>
      I can add images using the image tag and src attribute.</div>
      <br>  
  #This is the image structure, but I do not have an image. img src="xx" alt="no image"
      <br>
  #Here is the instructor note duplication attempt.
      <br>

      <div><b>1 - What a Web Page is</b>
      <br>
      A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</div>
      <br>
      <div><b>2 - How Coding Works</b>
      <br>
      Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.  The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.</div>
      <br>
      <div><b>3 - Computers are Stupid</b>
      <br>
       Programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax")</div>
      <br>
      <div><b>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b>
      <br>
      There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make test italic on HTML, you can always just look it up.</div>
      <br>
      <div><b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
      You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.</div>
      <br>
        <li> <b>Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags, called "void" tags do not require a closing tag.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Element:</b> A HTML element referes to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Attribute:</b> This is a property of a HTML element.</li>
